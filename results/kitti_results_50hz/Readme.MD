## kitti_results_50hz

These are results from pretrained prednet model on the full sample of the shanghai avi's, 
with 20 10-frame video clips from 108 avi's for a total of approximately 20 video clips.

The original avi's were 50 Hz, and these were also sampled at 50hz; thus, the clips are 1/5 seconds.

The csv's have the MSE's by batch number, and can be read by mse_hist.
